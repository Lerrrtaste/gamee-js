Gamee runs games in a webview on mobile platforms (iOS/Android) and in
an iframe  on the desktop. Gamee handles the controls and communication
with the services.
  
index.html
----------
To communicate with Gamee you should use [gamee.js]. It can be 
downloaded from gitlab or you can use [bower].

There are several "prepacked" versions of gamee, mostly you should use

```html
  <script src="vendor/gamee.all.js"></script>
```

The _*.min.*_ versions are minified (with uglify) meant to be included
in the release package of your game.

##### Bower installation

```bash
bower install https://github.com/gameeapp/gamee-js.git
```

Using the *wiredep* plugin we can handle the inclusion automatically

```html
  <!-- bower:js -->
  <!-- endbower -->
```

gamee
-----
Gamee.js exposes the [gamee] object in the global namespace.

### Controller
First you have to declare the type of the controller you want to use.

After that you can bind the controller's keys to your desired effect.
See [controller.js] for more information.

```javascript
var controller = gamee.controller.requestController('FourButtons', {enableKeyboard: true});

controller.buttons.left.on('keydown', mygame.goLeft);
controller.buttons.right.on('keydown', mygame.goRight);

// ..

mygame.update = function(dt) {
  // ..
  if (controller.buttons.A.isDown()) {
    this.fire();
  } 
  // ..
}

```

In the example we requested a *FourButton* controller, which has 3 
arrow keys and one action key. Then we bound the keys to a game action
and in the game update method we also check the state of the action
button.

### Showing the game state
You have to message the game state to the Gamee (playing/game over), so
the first message after loading and initializing must be 

```javascript
gamee.gameStart()
```

After the game ends (user has reached the end or failed on some level)
you have to call

```javascript
gamee.gameOver()
```

After the user or gamee send a restart request, you should also call
*gameStart*.

### Handling user events
User events outside controller interaction are handled with callbacks 
assigned into *gamee* object

E.g. handling the pause event

```javascript
gamee.onPause = function() {
  myGame.pause();
}

gamee.onResume = function() {
  myGame.unpause();
}
```
